# Welcome

A task manager that uses:
1. useState: to manipulate inputs
1. useEffect: to interact with localStorage
1. useReducer: to handle multiple state operations
1. useMemo: to memoize return values
1. useCallback: to memoize functions
1. useRef: to manipulate DOM of an element; in this case it is the input field 

and a custom hook "useLocalStorage" to store data or extract it from localStorage

### Don't forget to run 'npm install'!
