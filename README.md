# Welcome

A task manager that uses:
1. useState: to manipulate inputs
1. useEffect: to interact with localStorage
1. useReducer: to handle multiple state operations
1. useMemo: to memoize return values
1. useCallback: to memoize functions

and a custom hook "useLocalStorage" to store data or extract it from localStorage
